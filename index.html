            <h3>Engineering Students at Queen's</h3>

            <h4>Fourth Year Students</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Engineers in the Class of 2018 must complete a total minimum of 35 Total Hours.</li>
                <li>
                    At least 15 of these hours MUST be completed during Final Week, unless takedown hours were completed
                    –
                    See next bullet point. However, more than 10 hours can be completed during Final Week; these will
                    count
                    towards your Total Hours.
                </li>
                <li>Sci ’18s had the option to complete 5 hours during takeover/takedown for Sci ’17’s Formal.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you completed less than 5 hours, the remainder are left as final week hours.</li>
                        <li>If you completed more than 5 hours, those count towards regular hours.</li>
                        <li>If you completed the 5 hours, you will only have to complete 10 hours during Final Week</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Ex. You did 8 takedown hours last year. You now have 10 final + 17 regular hours remaining (27
                    total)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ex. You did 3 takedown hours last year. You now have 12 final + 20 regular hours remaining (32
                    total)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fifth Year Students</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Fifth year students who did not choose to attend their own Sci Formal can purchase a Sci ’18 ticket
                    and must complete 35 total hours with <b>15 of those hours being Final Week hours.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are a fifth-year student who did attend your own Sci Formal you can only attend our Sci
                    Formal as a guest.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Guests</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Guests who attend Queen’s (students not in Sci ’18) must complete 15 Total Hours, including 5 Final
                    Week Hours.
                </li>
                <li>Guests who do not attend Queen’s are not required to complete any hours.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Internship Students</h3>
            <p>
                All Sci ’18s completing an internship next year are still eligible to attend Sci Formal, only if their
                internship is organized through QUIP.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interns do still have to complete hours, but do not have to complete final week hours. Interns can
                complete hours at any time in the fall before Science Formal.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Students located in Kingston must complete 30 total hours. These hours can be completed at any
                    time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Students located within 300 km of Kingston (GTA, Montreal, Ottawa, etc.) must complete 15 total
                    hours. These 15 hours can be completed at any time.
                </li>
                <li>Students located more than 300 km away from Kingston do not have to complete any hours.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please get back to them as soon as possible when you get this email, so we can update your hour
                requirements in the system. If you do not receive this email by the end of August, please contact
                <a href="mailto:sciformal.communications@engsoc.queensu.ca">sciformal.communications@engsoc.queensu.ca</a>.
            </p>

            <h2 class="major">Hour Reductions</h2>

            <p>
                If you are involved in activities outside of school or you have a personal situation that you feel may
                hinder you from completing your Science Formal hour requirements, you may qualify for an hour
                reduction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Policy regarding the hour reductions will be posted during the first week of school along with the hour
                reduction application. The Communications Chair will be providing both.
            </p>
            <p>Activities that can qualify you for an hour reduction include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Varsity athlete</li>
                <li>Part time job</li>
                <li>School field trips</li>
                <li>Conference Executive Committees</li>
                <li>ASUS Involvement</li>
                <li>EngSoc Involvement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you feel your situation qualifies you for an hour reduction, please fill out the hour reduction
                application that will be provided. We will get back to you as soon as possible regarding the status of
                your application. If you have any questions, please contact Kristen Wadey (Communications Chair).
            </p>
            <p>The deadline will be posted along with the applications.</p>

            <h2 class="major">Hour Transfers</h2>
            <p>
                Hours can be transferred from one student to another (including guests), at a rate of 2-1. For example,
                if you do 10 extra hours you can transfer those to a friend who will be credited with 5 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you completed takeover hours at last year’s Science Formal and are not attending Science Formal CXV,
                you can transfer those hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have received an hour reduction, you cannot transfer hour reduction hours, but you can transfer
                any other hours you have earned (ie. warehouse hours).
            </p>
            <p>
                All hours retain their type when they are transferred (ie. regular, final). But overflow final week
                hours that you have received will count towards your total hour requirement, as usual.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please email <a href="mailto:sciformalweb@engsoc.queensu.ca">sciformalweb@engsoc.queensu.ca</a> to
                request an hour transfer, and include the following information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name</li>
                <li>Your net ID</li>
                <li>Recipient name</li>
                <li>Recipient net ID</li>
                <li>
                    How many hours you are transferring (and the type). i.e. 5 regular hours and 2 final hours becomes
                    2.5 regular and 1 final
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Sci Formal IT Managers will aim to complete hour transfers within a week after receiving the
                request, so please check the hour logger then. No email will be sent to say that it has been completed,
                so make sure to continuously check the hour logger after submitting this request.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that if you and/or the recipient have not signed in to the online hour logging system your
                hour transfer may be delayed beyond a week.
            </p>

            <h2 class="major">Buying Out Hours</h2>
            <p>
                Hours can be purchased during final week in Grant Hall along with the remaining amount for the ticket to
                attend the formal.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular hours: $15/hour</li>
                <li>Final Week hours: $20/hour</li>

            <h3 class="major">Dates and Prices</h3>
            <h4><b>Sci’ 18 Tickets:</b> $125 ($60 deposit)</h4>
            <p>
                A $60 deposit for the Science Formal ticket will be sold in the ILC atrium during week 1. Please note
                that:
                <b>Please note, according to Canadian law, deposits are not required to be refundable.</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Because of this, no refunds will be given after the deposit is paid, except for extenuating
                    circumstances.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Sci Formal committee reserves the right to decide what is considered an extenuating
                    circumstance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you would like to request a refund, please contact the 2017 Sci Formal Finance Chair, Matt
                    Boulby, at
                    <a href="mailto:sciformal.finance@engsoc.queensu.ca">sciformal.finance@engsoc.queensu.ca</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You do not need to have your hours completed to reserve your ticket. You will pay the remaining $65
                after you have completed all your hours in final week. Buying the rest of your ticket is the last step.
                At that time, any hours not completed must be purchased if you wish to pay the remaining part of your
                ticket.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Guest Tickets:</b> $150 ($75 deposit)</h4>
            <p>
                Guest ticket deposits will be purchased later in the semester, after deposit sales for Sci’ 18 have been
                completed. The remaining $75 will be paid during Final Week, just like Sci’ 18 tickets. As with Sci’ 18,
                guests that are required to do hours do not have to have the completed to reserve their ticket, but must
                have them completed to buy the second half of the ticket. Any hours not completed can be bought out, as
                with Sci’ 18.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any questions regarding any of this information should be directed to Matt Boulby, the 2017 Sci Formal
                Finance Chair, at
                <a href="mailto:sciformal.finance@engsoc.queensu.ca">sciformal.finance@engsoc.queensu.ca</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Guest Tickets</h3>
            <p>
                Due to capacity limits on our venue, a limited number of guest tickets are available, decided by a
                lottery.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may put a guest on the guest list at the time of making your ticket deposit. Please know their Net
                ID
                (if they are a Queen’s student) and email. No two people can put the same person down for a guest
                ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first round of guest ticket sales will close on a to be determined date in September. At this point,
                a raffle will be held to give out the guest tickets (based on the capacity remaining once all Sci‘18s
                have had the chance to purchase a ticket). Any guests not given a ticket during this period will be
                placed on a waitlist.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a to be determined date in September, individuals will be notified they have received a guest ticket,
                or where they are on the waitlist, via email.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have received a ticket, you have until a to be determined date in October to pay for the guest
                ticket deposit. There will be designated times to pay for deposits released during that week. Cash,
                cheque (to Engineering Society of Queen’s University), debit and credit are acceptable payment methods
                (note there is a $1 charge for debit purchases, and a 2% charge for credit purchases). If not, the guest
                ticket becomes available again and is given to the first name on the waitlist.
            </p>
            <p>Guests who attend Queen’s are required to complete hours (but not while on the waiting list).</p>
            <p>
                Please direct any questions related to guest tickets to the 2017 Sci Formal Finance Chair, Matt Boulby,
                at <a href="mailto:sciformal.finance@engsoc.queensu.ca">sciformal.finance@engsoc.queensu.ca</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Refunds & Transfers</h3>
            <p>
                Ticket transfers must go through Sci Formal Committee to be valid. There will be a deadline in
                mid-October after which refunds will not be granted.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are selling a ticket, you will not be able to sell your ticket other than through Sci Formal and
                you will not be given the choice of who gets your ticket. The ticket will go to the next person on the
                waiting list, who will be contacted as the ticket is returned.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a student shows up on the night of the event and their name is not on our ticket list (as in the
                ticket transfer did not go through Sci Formal), they will not be allowed to enter the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to transfer your ticket, please email the 2017 Sci Formal Convener, Matt Clark, at
                <a href="mailto:sciformal.convener@engsoc.queensu.ca">sciformal.convener@engsoc.queensu.ca</a> and we
                will set up a time for you to get your money refunded to you.
                Once a ticket becomes available we will notify the next person on the waitlist that a ticket is
                available for them and provide instructions on how to collect that ticket.
            </p>

            <h3 class="major">Ticket Pick-up</h3>
            <p>
                During Final Week you can pick up your ticket at Grant after completing your hours by paying the
                remaining $60 (as well as buying out any uncompleted hours). Cash, cheque, and debit/credit are accepted
                methods of payment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before going to pick-up your ticket, please visit the sign-in desk to verify that your hours are
                completed. Once verified, visit the ticket pick-up desk and pay for the remainder of your ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also pre-purchase drink and photo tickets. More information regarding this will be posted soon.

                Science Formal is arguably the longest-standing tradition of Queen’s University. It has become one of
                the
                most highly anticipated events at Queen’s and offers invaluable project management, construction, and
                teamwork experience to the fourth-year engineering students for which the event is planned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fundamentally, the Science Formal is planned and executed each year as follows: the graduating students
                choose a theme for the event. The signature piece of the Formal is a huge structure built in the center
                of
                Grant Hall that varies year to year, depending on the theme. Past themes have been: Evening in Paris,
                Peter
                Pan, Old Hollywood, Mount Olympus, and this year Venetian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sponsorship is critical to the running of the formal each year, and we look to corporate sponsors for
                support
                in exchange for promotion of their brand and exposure to the graduating class of Queen’s Engineering and
                Applied Science. The event itself highlights the creative and collaborative nature of our students,
                and provides the graduating students with unparalleled undergraduate experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a public open house the afternoon before the formal, so the impressive structure and artistic
                work
                throughout the venue can be shared with the community. During this open house, the United Way of
                Kingston,
                Frontenac, Lennox and Addington are invited to collect donations at the venue entrance, strengthening
                the
                commitment of Queen’s Engineering students to supporting community initiatives.

            <h2 class="major">History</h2>
            <p>
                Science Formal is arguably the longest-standing tradition of Queen’s university. It has become one of
                the most highly anticipated events at Queen’s and offers invaluable project management, construction,
                and teamwork experience to the fourth-year engineering students for which the event is planned.
            </p>
            <p>
                The history of the Science Formal isn’t exact, but it is generally accepted that it dates to the early
                1900s where it began as a simple dance. It was the class of 1923 that first included more ambitious
                visions such as large structures and waterfalls. More elaborate themes started in 1927 with the Japanese
                Gardens. By the 1940’s, the development of major themes for the event was firmly established and the
                Science Formal was – and still is – an incredible event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fundamentally, the Science Formal is planned and executed each year as follows: the graduating students
                choose a theme for the event and Grant Hall and select parts of Kingston Hall are decorated according to
                this theme. The signature piece of the Formal is a huge structure in the centre of Grant Hall that
                varies year to year, depending on the theme. Recent Formals have celebrated such themes as Sci’07’s
                <em>Scientia Septem Semper Parvulus</em> (Peter Pan), Sci’08’s Broadway with its own Times Square,
                Sci’09’s <em>Corruptiornamentumnovern</em> (James Bond) with an airplane and two watch towers filling
                Grant Hall, Sci’10’s <em>Exordiumeximius</em>, with a large Babylonian pyramid surrounded by the Hanging
                Gardens, Sci’ 11’s <em>Solemnitasplagiariusterra</em> (Planet Earth) with rooms incorporating the
                variety of nature offered by the earth, and Sci ‘12s <em>Grandaeurbesorbis</em> (Great Cities of the
                World).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Science Formal provides the graduating students with unparalleled undergraduate experience in
                design, construction, creative thinking, problem solving, leadership, management, and teamwork.  It
                truly is an incredible event, marking the culmination of 4 years of engineering at Queen’s.

            <p>The Science Formal CXV Open House will take place on November 4th, 2017.</p>
            <p>
                During this time, Grant Hall and Kingston Hall will be open to the public for walk-throughs, by donation
                to the United Way. This is a great time to take pictures with friends and family, and to really take in
                the results of all the hard work of the 4th year engineering students and their guests!
